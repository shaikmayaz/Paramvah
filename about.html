        <h1><sup>________&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>ABOUT US<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_________</sup></h1>
        <img src="./camera(about)1.webp" alt="">
        <p>Paramvah Studios aims to be a world class production house creating memorable films & characters using latest technologies & best creative talents. We are a production house, engaged in creating movie content and Paramvah Studios is more than just a name for us.

            Paramvah means the first vibration. According to a legend, the Paramvah came through Shiva's damroo, which was Om and he started dancing to the tune when the universe was formed. The music and Shiva's dance is a form of entertainment, which nobody has seen. The whole idea of keeping the name Paramvah is do something out-of-the-box.
            
            It encompasses the essence of our imagination, creativity and perseverance, which takes us closer to every creative person who can work with a creative space and with complete freedom.
            
            For some it is projects and for few assignments, they also call it dreams; for us it is passion! It is the passion that differentiates us from others. We are just a year old but inching towards completion of our first project that serves as platform to many debutants (people in front of the camera and behind the camera).</p>
